https://groceries.asda.com/recipes/carnation-salted-caramel-cheesecake/1852a4aa-0022-11ec-ba5b-e1ccddcd4745,Carnation Salted Caramel Cheesecake	,A silky smooth baked cheesecake finished with Carnation Caramel Drizzle Sauce for a deeply drippy finish.,cheesecake pudding caramel salted caramel bakes baking,Baking Dessert,Greek,175g  light digestive biscuits 3tbsp cocoa powder 2tbsp granulated sugar 75g baking spread 500g  light soft cheese 150ml  half fat crème fraiche 3 medium eggs 1/2tsp flaky sea salt 2tsp vanilla extract 450g carnation caramel drizzle,Preheat the oven to 180°c (160°c for fan ovens) gas mark 4.Crush the biscuits in a strong sealed food bag with a rolling pin or blitz in a food processor. Tip the crumbs into a bowl and mix in the cocoa. Mix the sugar with the melted butter and add to the crushed biscuits stir until combined. Press the crumbs into the base of the tin and even out to make the base. Chill the base in the fridge while you make the filling.In a food processor blend the cream cheese until smooth. Add the eggs one at a time with the processor running on low speed. Next add the salt vanilla and crème fraiche 400g Carnation Caramel drizzle and blend until smooth. (If you can't find our Carnation Caramel drizzle you can use carnation caramel - put 350g caramel in the filling and add a couple of tablespoons of sugar to compensate for the sweetness. Then you can use the rest filled into a piping bag to drizzle over the top of the finished cheesecake.)Take the chilled biscuit base and wrap the outside of the tin in a layer of foil so that the base and the sides are watertight. Then repeat for a double layer and stand the tin in a roasting dish. Pour the filling onto the biscuit base.Surround the tin with 3cm (1¼”) of hot water from the kettle and bake in the centre of the preheated oven for 45 minutes. (This bain marie or water bath method helps to set the cheesecake gently without the risk of overbaking it. Once baked the centre of the cheesecake should still have a good wobble - don't worry cool it slowly and after chilling it will give you a silky smooth finish.)Turn off the oven and without opening the door leave the cheesecake in the oven for 1 hour to set. Remove to a rack to cool and then chill overnight. Letting the cheesecake cool down slowly will help to prevent the top of the cheesecake from cracking.Just before you serve the cheesecake pour over some more of the Carnation Caramel drizzle and then enjoy!,Each serving of this recipe contains 342kcal of Energy.
